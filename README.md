# Pathfinding visualizer
A java implementation of pathfinding algorithms.

Allows custom built mazes and starting points to find optimal paths thorugh the maze.


# Implemented algorithms

A*
Dijkstra's algorithm
Greedy Search


# Functionality
The Program allows for the creation of custom mazes and randomly generated mazes.

The user can then test one of the three above algorithms in the mazes.

The user can controll the speed of the search to aid in visualization as well as toggle the current checked path to be shown in the visualization.

The maze can be cleared which removes all the custom wall, or rest which resest the canvas to its default state.

# How to use

To create wall draw on the grid with the left mouse button. Walls can be removed with the right mouse button.

The start and end targets can be picked up and dropped with the middle mouse button.

To begin a search click the desired algorithm on the right of the screen.

While searching the speed and trace can be toggled and selected using their respective buttons.

To clear or reset the maze press the clear or reset button.

# How to run

To run the program simply compile and then run the Pathfinder class in the default package.
make sure to have java installed.


# Processing
The tools useed to create the graphics were created by the Processing foundation.
